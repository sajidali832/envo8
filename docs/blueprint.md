## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant and inviting rose (#F72585) to capture attention. Rose gives off a premium glow without appearing too serious.
- Background color: Light grayish rose (#F2E8EF), a desaturated version of the primary. This light backdrop complements the vibrant primary, giving off an impression of subtle glowing.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#4361EE) for interactive elements. Analogous to the primary rose, it offers contrast and visual appeal for focus elements, guiding users through investment options.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font, which will give a blend of modern design and approachability that will match the Pakistani audience.
- Clean, modern icons with a thin line style to match the light theme.
- Mobile-first responsive design with clear, structured sections for easy navigation.
- Subtle animations for page transitions and loading screens.
